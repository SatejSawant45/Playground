# 🛠️ Playground

This is my personal **experimentation repo**.  
I use it to try out random ideas, test code snippets, and play around with new tools/technologies.  

The structure and content may be arbitrary and change anytime.  
Nothing here is production-ready — just experiments and learning. 🚀
